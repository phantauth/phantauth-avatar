# PhantAuth Avatar

PhantAuth Avatar service returns a human avatar picture URL based on an identifier which can be an email, hash, username or any other text after the 
[https://phantauth.net/img/avatar/](https://phantauth.net/img/avatar/) prefix.
The returned picture URL is generated from the identifier in a deterministic way. If you omit the identifier, then a random profile picture URL will be returned. You can specify the gender of the generated image by appending `;male` or `;female` to the identifier.
